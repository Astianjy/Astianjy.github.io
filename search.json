Children wearing face paint crowded a petting zoo. Families held balloons and bubble wands.\nYet as the sun began to dip, two men dressed in black and wielding long-barrelled firearms shot into the crowd from positions just outside the beach-side park where the event was taking place. They murdered at least 15 people and injured dozens more, including two police officers.\nAnthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, confirmed the massacre was a “targeted attack on Jewish Australians.” He labelled the attack “a terrorist incident”; that designation gives authorities additional powers to question and detain suspects. The dead include Eli Schlanger, a prominent local rabbi and the organiser of the event.\nThe attack is one of the worst shootings in modern Australian history, even if the final toll will take some days to come clear. And but for the immense courage of bystanders, it might have been even more lethal. One video shows a man in a white T-shirt creeping up on one of the gunmen from behind a car, then wrestling the attacker’s rifle away from him.\n“That man is a genuine hero,” said Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales. “I’ve got no doubt that there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.”\nThe attack ended when police shot dead one of the alleged gunmen, 50, and took his son, 24 — the second presumed attacker, said to be injured — into custody. Police later confirmed that a search of a vehicle left in the area and linked to the attackers uncovered several improvised explosive devices. The intention was clearly to inflict even greater devastation than has been wrought.\nSince the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Australia has seen a spate of antisemitic incidents, including arson attacks on synagogues. In August, Australia expelled the Iranian ambassador after credible intelligence suggested that Iran had financed and directed at least two arson attacks on Australian soil — on a Jewish business and a synagogue. It was the first such expulsion since the second world war.\nIn February, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia’s domestic intelligence service, said fighting antisemitism had become his agency’s top priority because of the “threats to life… we’re seeing play out in this country.”\nMuslim groups condemned the terrorist attack. “These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society,” the Australian National Imams Council said in a statement. “Those responsible must be held fully accountable and face the full force of the law.”\nThe coming days will doubtless also bring renewed debate about firearms. Mass killings in Australia are very rare; the country’s strict gun laws — commonly praised internationally — are one reason for that. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons were largely banned in 1996 after a gunman killed 35 people during a rampage in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur. At the time, the government purchased hundreds of thousands of firearms from the Australian public.\nYet for the past five years there have been more guns registered in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur massacre, according to a report released in January by the Australia Institute, a think-tank. Expect much more discussion about that in the days ahead.\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated.\n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["Extremism","Public Security","Australia","Antisemitism"]},{"title":"China proved its strengths in 2025—and Donald Trump helped","url":"/2025/12/23/China%20proved%20its%20strengths%20in%202025%E2%80%94and%20Donald%20Trump%20helped/","content":"China proved its strengths in 2025—and Donald Trump helped\nThe big noise in 2025 has been President Donald Trump. Launching a barrage of executive orders, he directed his fire at target after target. With the aid of Elon Musk, he attempted to dismantle the federal bureaucracy. On “Liberation Day” he rewrote the rules of trade. Around the world he imposed peace and threatened war.\nHowever, the big beneficiary has been President Xi Jinping. This year China defied Mr Trump’s attempt to use tariffs to force a show of submission. By turning the tables, Mr Xi revealed just how much America actually depends on his policies. In this round of the superpowers’ fight for 21st-century supremacy, it was a victory for China.\nChina’s industrial chokeholdsThis year showed the power of China’s industrial chokeholds. China’s share of the world’s manufacturing value added exceeds one-third, giving it the power to disrupt global supply chains overnight. In green technology, Chinese firms supply the materials, components and finished goods for 60-80% of solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. DeepSeek showed what China can do in artificial intelligence, despite America’s best efforts to hobble it. China’s drug firms now run nearly as many clinical trials as their American peers—and do them faster.\nTwo decades ago Western firms invested in China to take advantage of its cheap producers and huge market. Today they build laboratories there.\nIn 2025 Mr Xi showed he is willing to use China’s dominance as not just a source of wealth, but of power. His restrictions on rare-earth exports are one example of how China can use other countries’ dependency as a weapon. Findings this month from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute show that China leads in research in 66 of 74 fields, measured by its share of key scientific papers. These include over two dozen areas, such as computer vision and grid integration, where it has a chokehold.\nHow Mr Trump helped Mr XiThe extraordinary thing is that Mr Trump has played into Mr Xi’s hands, both with his tariffs abroad and his wrecking-ball at home. Choosing bilateral tariffs as a way to inflict pain on China was a mistake. Partly because Chinese firms are used to harsh conditions and partly because China is not a democracy, its economy is better at enduring pain than America’s. Mr Trump could instead have co-ordinated a commercial encirclement of China by integrating more deeply with America’s allies. Foolishly, he preferred to alienate them with tariffs.\nLikewise, Mr Trump’s attack on science will impede American innovation. He has targeted researchers, cancelling grants and withholding billions of dollars in funding to institutions that he does not like. Framed as an effort to eliminate inefficiency and woke ideology, his efforts have curbed financing for vital research. His hostility to foreign scientists, especially ethnic Chinese ones, is part of a more general assault on immigration. Talented people will either leave America or choose not to move there. China has already benefited.\nThe balance of powerThe question is where this leaves the superpowers. In the short run, the advantage is surely with China. America and its allies cannot soon deprive it of its chokeholds. Should Mr Xi choose to throttle Taiwan, America and its allies may find that sanctions intended to force China to back off will trigger reprisals that cause more harm than their industries and citizens are willing to bear. That would have grave implications for East Asian security, and for America’s role in the western Pacific.\nIn the longer run, China’s dynamism could be stifled by its rigid politics. To see why, consider its economy. Factory-gate prices were 2.2% lower in November than a year earlier, and have declined for 38 months in a row. Property prices in the secondary market are more than 20% below their peak and still falling. Although the party has pledged to stimulate domestic demand next year, it will also double down on strategic manufacturing—the very thinking that has mired it in overcapacity.\nBy the end of 2026 that may seem like hubris. As provinces and cities struggle to pay down debt, stagnation could become even more entrenched, a bit like Japan’s lost decades. Deflation could worsen if countries unwilling to lose their own industries block more of China’s cut-price exports. Yet as Mr Xi prepares to start a fourth term in charge in 2027, his underlings seemingly cannot or will not challenge him.\nAmerica’s advantage—and its riskIn China the bigger the mistake, the less willing the party is to change course. By contrast, America has change built in—indeed maga’s bent for deregulation and its impatience with the suffocating effects of elite political correctness were examples of that principle in action. Whereas China is an ethno-nationalist state in which people who are not Han Chinese struggle to be accepted, America is founded on universal values that speak to every race and creed. These values have long made America a magnet for talent and enhanced its global influence. In the past they have also bound together its alliances.\nIn theory, all that should be the basis for renewal. However, Mr Trump scorns universal values as gimmicks exploited by cynical foreigners. Oppression does not shock him: he admires iron-fisted rulers, especially when they are also rich. As his recent National Security Strategy showed, maga sees ethnic and religious diversity as a threat, not a source of strength. If America is just one more ethno-nationalist project like Russia or China it will squander its greatest advantage.\nNext summer America will mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. That should be the occasion for a debate about the republic’s founding principles. America’s economy remains the envy of the world. Nowhere else can mobilise ideas and capital on such a scale. Its people possess tremendous reserves of skill and enterprise.\nIdeally, this would mean that the hopes of renewal will burn bright. The question is how much Mr Trump’s corruption of public life, his administration’s vindictiveness towards those in public service and his diminishment of Congress will dim America’s prospects. Mr Xi will be watching.\n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["China","United States","Geopolitics","Great Power Competition","Donald Trump","Xi Jinping"]},{"title":"Is China really a nation of slackers?","url":"/2025/12/24/Is%20China%20really%20a%20nation%20of%20slackers/","content":"Is China really a nation of slackers?\nPhotograph: Getty Images\nChina is famous, even infamous, for hard graft. Prodigious amounts of toil and elbow grease helped the country become the workshop of the world. More than 175m migrant workers labour in cities far from home, often leaving their children in the care of relatives. And the sacrifices are not confined to the poor. Even some of China’s more sophisticated firms are known for their “996” office culture, encouraging unfortunate employees to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.\nMany Chinese people therefore reacted with surprise and no little scorn to a new official survey of how they spend their time. The study, only the third of its kind, claimed that the average resident devotes less than three and a half hours a day to paid labour.\n“They must have surveyed government workers only,” quipped one on social media. “Did they go to kindergartens and care homes?” asked another.\nMany official statistics in China invite scepticism or even ridicule because they appear to unduly flatter the government. However, this result would appear to do the opposite. China’s leaders would like citizens to remain industrious and diligent even as the country advances. Indeed, they worry that prosperity will induce decadence and indolence.\nMany younger Chinese have, for example, rebelled against the rat races of professional employment and decided instead to “lie flat”, resigning themselves to low-key, bit-part jobs that at least offer a less stressful life. Is this phenomenon now showing up in the national statistics? Does the survey show that China is beginning to slack off?\nThe survey was certainly thorough. China’s National Bureau of Statistics got in touch with more than 100,000 people, asking them to record what they were doing at 15-minute intervals, both on a weekday and at the weekend. But this introduces the first complication. One reason why China’s daily workload appears surprisingly light is because the hours are averaged across all seven days of the week.\nIf someone works a regular eight-hour shift and enjoys a two-day weekend, their paid labour averages less than six hours a day in the survey. Even a slavish 996er would log not 12 hours a day, but ten hours, 17 minutes, once their solitary day off was taken into account.\nAlthough online critics were wrong to suggest the survey extended to children in kindergarten, they were not that wrong. The survey encompasses children as young as six, as well as the retired. That is another reason why the headline average appeared low: it was dragged down by people not in the labour market at all.\nWhen the young and the old are excluded, China’s work hours still look onerous by international standards (see chart). Working weeks tend to shorten as countries get richer, but China’s hours are longer than you might expect given its level of economic development. Excluding non-workers, Chinese people aged between 18 and 59 logged six hours and 32 minutes a day on average, an amount that produces an average working week of over 45 hours.\nOn top of paid work, of course, is the unpaid kind. The survey shows that more than four in five women and two in three men carried out child care, housework, shopping or some other form of unremunerated labour. The women put in almost three and a half hours on average; the men did only half as much. The gender split was even worse than in the last survey in 2018, when men did 60% as much as women.\nThe survey does not therefore reveal China to have transformed into a nation of slackers. At the same time, its people do genuinely seem to be working a little less intensely than they were last time they were surveyed. All told, they are spending nine fewer minutes on housework, and 23 minutes less on caring for other family members. They also sleep for 27 extra minutes on average.\nBut the biggest change in their daily habits is not lying flat but logging on. Chinese people spend five hours and 37 minutes a day surfing the internet, up by almost three hours since 2018.\nApart from extra minutes in bed and online, Chinese people have also increased the time devoted to less sedentary and perhaps more worthwhile activities. Almost half of Chinese residents now take part in sports and exercise, compared with less than one-third in 2018.\nMaybe the country’s exacting leaders need not fear: when the Chinese people are not working hard, more of them are working out. \n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["China","Labour","996","Lying flat"]},{"title":"Why China’s spat with Japan could still get worse","url":"/2025/12/23/Why%20China%E2%80%99s%20spat%20with%20Japan%20could%20still%20get%20worse/","content":"Why China’s spat with Japan could still get worse\nPhotograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\n“For nigh on 1,000 years, the Japanese pirates have wreaked havoc…they respect only force, and their hearts are bursting with malice.”\nThis month China’s armed forces released these verses on social media. As poetry, it is perhaps not the best. But the message was clear enough. To hammer it home, the poem was accompanied by a cartoon of a skeleton, wearing a Japanese army cap, trying to clutch the island of Taiwan. A giant sword, swung from China’s mainland, is cutting its head off.\nThis winter is the frostiest in Sino-Japanese relations for over a decade. It all started on November 7th, when Japan’s prime minister, Takaichi Sanae (pictured), was asked in the Diet about what situations could prompt Japan to exercise “collective self-defence”. The phrase refers to Japan’s proclaimed right to defend an ally with its armed forces when deemed necessary for Japan’s own survival. That would apply if China were to attack Taiwan, she suggested. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, was furious. Its officials have piled pressure on Japan to get Ms Takaichi to retract her comments. So far, though, the government has sought to calibrate how its citizens express their anger.\nAs Chinese officials see it, Ms Takaichi’s comments not only infringed on its sovereignty but also resurrected the ghosts of Japan’s imperial past (Japan ruled Taiwan from 1895 until the end of the second world war and fought China for much of this period). China also claims that Japan’s ongoing military build-up—which in part is an attempt to deter its superpower neighbour—threatens regional security.\nOnline commenters in China are furious, too. The Economist has been monitoring the sentiment of posts mentioning Japan on Weibo, an X-like platform recently. On a scale of zero to one, where zero reflects an entirely negative statement and one a wholly positive one, average sentiment collapsed from 0.6 on November 7th to 0.3 on November 21st (see chart). That is the lowest since we started tracking at the start of the year.\nChina is pushing on several fronts in response. Its diplomats have harangued Japan at the United Nations. It has sent coastguard ships to islands that both countries claim (Japan calls them the Senkaku islands and China the Diaoyu). Chinese fighter jets locked their radars onto Japanese planes near Okinawa in Japan earlier in December (an act that can signal a potential attack and force evasive action). China has also imposed sanctions on a former chief of Japan’s self-defence forces.\nBut it is in waging economic warfare that China excels. It has placed import bans on Japanese seafood and warned Chinese citizens that it is unsafe to travel to Japan. The idea is to hurt the country’s tourism revenues (a recent report from the state-run China Daily claims Chinese tourists are changing their winter-holiday plans to go to South Korea and South-East Asia). Officials have also cancelled showings of Japanese films and performances by Japanese musicians. On November 29th Ayumi Hamasaki, a singer, performed in an empty 14,000-seat stadium in Shanghai after organisers axed her show at the last minute. A day earlier another Japanese star was forced to leave the stage in mid-performance.\nDuring previous disputes the Chinese government encouraged people to boycott Japanese shops and restaurants, too. This time it has not done that. The Chinese public, though angry at Japan, seem happy to keep consuming its products. Ms Mao, a middle-aged Beijinger, has gone on holiday to Japan in the past. She now deems the country unsafe, because of the spat. “But I’ll still buy what I want to buy,” she says, eyeing perfumed candles in Muji, a Japanese household-goods shop. Nearby, the main Beijing branch of Uniqlo, a Japanese clothing retailer, was full of shoppers on a recent afternoon. When Sushiro, a Japanese sushi chain, opened new joints in Shanghai this month, long queues formed outside. Toyota sales in China have been steady so far this year.\nChina may be unwilling to unleash nationalist fury, which can be hard to control. During another spat, in 2012, over the Senkaku or Diaoyu islands, thousands of Chinese took to the streets, smashing Japanese restaurants and cars. Such scenes seem unlikely to happen today because officials increasingly prize political stability. And they may also be wary of doing anything that might further weaken consumer sentiment. In November retail sales grew by just 1.3%, the slowest pace since 2022. Alternatively, officials may just be keeping their powder dry. “The struggle against Japan could be a protracted one,” warned Hu Xijin, a well-known nationalist, on Weibo last month.\n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["China","Geopolitics","Japan","Nationalism","Economic coercion"]},{"title":"Administrator Protection: Secure Your Admins!","url":"/2025/12/22/Administrator%20Protection%EF%BC%9ASecure%20Your%20Admins/","content":"How the New UAC Works vs. Legacy UAC\n1.
