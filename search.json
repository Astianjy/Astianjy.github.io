Legacy UAC: Split Token ModelIn the traditional UAC model, when a user who belongs to the local Administrators group logs in, Windows creates two access tokens for that user:\n\nA standard user token\nAn administrator token (filtered but already present)\n\nBy default, all processes run under the standard token.\nWhen an administrative action is requested (e.g., “Run as administrator”), UAC prompts the user. If consent is granted, the same user account switches to its existing admin token and launches the elevated process.\nKey characteristics of legacy UAC:\n\nThe admin token already exists for the entire session\nElevation means activating an existing token, not creating a new identity\nMalware that gains sufficient access may:\nAbuse UAC auto-elevation\nBypass or hijack the consent mechanism\n\n\nAdmin privileges are logically separated, but still tied to the user account\n\n\n2. New UAC (Administrator Protection): Isolated Admin Account ModelWith Administrator Protection enabled (Windows 11 25H2+), Windows fundamentally changes the elevation mechanism.\nInstead of elevating the current user, Windows uses a System-Managed, hidden Administrator Account that is:\n\nSeparate from the logged-in user\nDisabled and inactive by default\nActivated only during an elevation request\n\nWhen an administrative action is required:\n\nThe user initiates an action requiring elevation\nWindows displays a Windows Security prompt (not the classic UAC dialog)\nUpon approval:\nWindows temporarily activates the system-managed admin account\nCreates a new elevated process under this separate account\n\n\nThe elevated process runs in an isolated admin context, with:\nA separate admin token\nA separate admin profile\nA separate registry hive (admin-specific data hive)\n\n\nOnce the task completes, the admin session is terminated and privileges are revoked\n\nKey characteristics of the new model:\n\nNo persistent admin token exists in the user session\nAdmin privileges are not tied to the user account\nElevation uses a different security principal, not the logged-in user\nPrivileges are granted just-in-time and just-for-task\nSignificantly reduces attack surface for privilege escalation\n\n\n3. Security Impact: Why This Is a Major Change\n\n\nAspect\nLegacy UAC\nAdministrator Protection\n\n\n\nAdmin token lifetime\nEntire user session\nOnly during elevation\n\n\nAdmin identity\nSame user account\nSeparate system-managed account\n\n\nPrivilege exposure\nContinuous (filtered)\nEphemeral\n\n\nToken theft risk\nHigher\nGreatly reduced\n\n\nUAC bypass impact\nOften effective\nLargely ineffective\n\n\nFrom a security perspective, the new UAC aligns with:\n\nZero Trust principles\nLeast privilege enforcement\nPrivilege isolation and session compartmentalization\n\nEven if an attacker compromises the user session, they cannot reuse or hijack admin privileges, because those privileges exist only in a short-lived, isolated execution context.\n\n4. One-Sentence Summary\nLegacy UAC elevates the user; Administrator Protection elevates a temporary, isolated system-managed admin identity.\n\n","categories":["Windows Security"],"tags":["Windows 11","UAC","Administrator Protection","Privilege Escalation","Security Architecture","OS Security"]},{"title":"After the Bondi Massacre, Australia Faces Hard Questions About Extremism","url":"/2025/12/22/After%20the%20Bondi%20Massacre,%20Australia%20Faces%20Hard%20Questions%20About%20Extremism/","content":"After the Bondi Massacre, Australia Faces Hard Questions About Extremism\nPhotograph: AFP via Getty Images\nMore than a thousand people gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14th, the first night of Hannukah, to watch the lighting of a menorah. Children wearing face paint crowded a petting zoo. Families held balloons and bubble wands.\nYet as the sun began to dip, two men dressed in black and wielding long-barrelled firearms shot into the crowd from positions just outside the beach-side park where the event was taking place. They murdered at least 15 people and injured dozens more, including two police officers.\nAnthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, confirmed the massacre was a “targeted attack on Jewish Australians.” He labelled the attack “a terrorist incident”; that designation gives authorities additional powers to question and detain suspects. The dead include Eli Schlanger, a prominent local rabbi and the organiser of the event.\nThe attack is one of the worst shootings in modern Australian history, even if the final toll will take some days to come clear. And but for the immense courage of bystanders, it might have been even more lethal. One video shows a man in a white T-shirt creeping up on one of the gunmen from behind a car, then wrestling the attacker’s rifle away from him.\n“That man is a genuine hero,” said Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales. “I’ve got no doubt that there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.”\nThe attack ended when police shot dead one of the alleged gunmen, 50, and took his son, 24 — the second presumed attacker, said to be injured — into custody. Police later confirmed that a search of a vehicle left in the area and linked to the attackers uncovered several improvised explosive devices. The intention was clearly to inflict even greater devastation than has been wrought.\nSince the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Australia has seen a spate of antisemitic incidents, including arson attacks on synagogues. In August, Australia expelled the Iranian ambassador after credible intelligence suggested that Iran had financed and directed at least two arson attacks on Australian soil — on a Jewish business and a synagogue. It was the first such expulsion since the second world war.\nIn February, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia’s domestic intelligence service, said fighting antisemitism had become his agency’s top priority because of the “threats to life… we’re seeing play out in this country.”\nMuslim groups condemned the terrorist attack. “These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society,” the Australian National Imams Council said in a statement. “Those responsible must be held fully accountable and face the full force of the law.”\nThe coming days will doubtless also bring renewed debate about firearms. Mass killings in Australia are very rare; the country’s strict gun laws — commonly praised internationally — are one reason for that. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons were largely banned in 1996 after a gunman killed 35 people during a rampage in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur. At the time, the government purchased hundreds of thousands of firearms from the Australian public.\nYet for the past five years there have been more guns registered in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur massacre, according to a report released in January by the Australia Institute, a think-tank. Expect much more discussion about that in the days ahead.\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated.\n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["Extremism","Terrorism","Public Security","Australia","Antisemitism"]}]
