Legacy UAC: Split Token ModelIn the traditional UAC model, when a user who belongs to the local Administrators group logs in, Windows creates two access tokens for that user:\n\nA standard user token\nAn administrator token (filtered but already present)\n\nBy default, all processes run under the standard token.\nWhen an administrative action is requested (e.g., “Run as administrator”), UAC prompts the user. If consent is granted, the same user account switches to its existing admin token and launches the elevated process.\nKey characteristics of legacy UAC:\n\nThe admin token already exists for the entire session\nElevation means activating an existing token, not creating a new identity\nMalware that gains sufficient access may:\nAbuse UAC auto-elevation\nBypass or hijack the consent mechanism\n\n\nAdmin privileges are logically separated, but still tied to the user account\n\n\n2. New UAC (Administrator Protection): Isolated Admin Account ModelWith Administrator Protection enabled (Windows 11 25H2+), Windows fundamentally changes the elevation mechanism.\nInstead of elevating the current user, Windows uses a System-Managed, hidden Administrator Account that is:\n\nSeparate from the logged-in user\nDisabled and inactive by default\nActivated only during an elevation request\n\nWhen an administrative action is required:\n\nThe user initiates an action requiring elevation\nWindows displays a Windows Security prompt (not the classic UAC dialog)\nUpon approval:\nWindows temporarily activates the system-managed admin account\nCreates a new elevated process under this separate account\n\n\nThe elevated process runs in an isolated admin context, with:\nA separate admin token\nA separate admin profile\nA separate registry hive (admin-specific data hive)\n\n\nOnce the task completes, the admin session is terminated and privileges are revoked\n\nKey characteristics of the new model:\n\nNo persistent admin token exists in the user session\nAdmin privileges are not tied to the user account\nElevation uses a different security principal, not the logged-in user\nPrivileges are granted just-in-time and just-for-task\nSignificantly reduces attack surface for privilege escalation\n\n\n3. Security Impact: Why This Is a Major Change\n\n\nAspect\nLegacy UAC\nAdministrator Protection\n\n\n\nAdmin token lifetime\nEntire user session\nOnly during elevation\n\n\nAdmin identity\nSame user account\nSeparate system-managed account\n\n\nPrivilege exposure\nContinuous (filtered)\nEphemeral\n\n\nToken theft risk\nHigher\nGreatly reduced\n\n\nUAC bypass impact\nOften effective\nLargely ineffective\n\n\nFrom a security perspective, the new UAC aligns with:\n\nZero Trust principles\nLeast privilege enforcement\nPrivilege isolation and session compartmentalization\n\nEven if an attacker compromises the user session, they cannot reuse or hijack admin privileges, because those privileges exist only in a short-lived, isolated execution context.\n\n4. One-Sentence Summary\nLegacy UAC elevates the user; Administrator Protection elevates a temporary, isolated system-managed admin identity.\n\n","categories":["Windows Security"],"tags":["Windows 11","UAC","Administrator Protection","Privilege Escalation","Security Architecture","OS Security"]},{"title":"After the Bondi Massacre, Australia Faces Hard Questions About Extremism","url":"/2025/12/22/After%20the%20Bondi%20Massacre,%20Australia%20Faces%20Hard%20Questions%20About%20Extremism/","content":"After the Bondi Massacre, Australia Faces Hard Questions About Extremism\nPhotograph: AFP via Getty Images\nMore than a thousand people gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14th, the first night of Hannukah, to watch the lighting of a menorah. Children wearing face paint crowded a petting zoo. Families held balloons and bubble wands.\nYet as the sun began to dip, two men dressed in black and wielding long-barrelled firearms shot into the crowd from positions just outside the beach-side park where the event was taking place. They murdered at least 15 people and injured dozens more, including two police officers.\nAnthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, confirmed the massacre was a “targeted attack on Jewish Australians.” He labelled the attack “a terrorist incident”; that designation gives authorities additional powers to question and detain suspects. The dead include Eli Schlanger, a prominent local rabbi and the organiser of the event.\nThe attack is one of the worst shootings in modern Australian history, even if the final toll will take some days to come clear. And but for the immense courage of bystanders, it might have been even more lethal. One video shows a man in a white T-shirt creeping up on one of the gunmen from behind a car, then wrestling the attacker’s rifle away from him.\n“That man is a genuine hero,” said Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales. “I’ve got no doubt that there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.”\nThe attack ended when police shot dead one of the alleged gunmen, 50, and took his son, 24 — the second presumed attacker, said to be injured — into custody. Police later confirmed that a search of a vehicle left in the area and linked to the attackers uncovered several improvised explosive devices. The intention was clearly to inflict even greater devastation than has been wrought.\nSince the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Australia has seen a spate of antisemitic incidents, including arson attacks on synagogues. In August, Australia expelled the Iranian ambassador after credible intelligence suggested that Iran had financed and directed at least two arson attacks on Australian soil — on a Jewish business and a synagogue. It was the first such expulsion since the second world war.\nIn February, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia’s domestic intelligence service, said fighting antisemitism had become his agency’s top priority because of the “threats to life… we’re seeing play out in this country.”\nMuslim groups condemned the terrorist attack. “These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society,” the Australian National Imams Council said in a statement. “Those responsible must be held fully accountable and face the full force of the law.”\nThe coming days will doubtless also bring renewed debate about firearms. Mass killings in Australia are very rare; the country’s strict gun laws — commonly praised internationally — are one reason for that. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons were largely banned in 1996 after a gunman killed 35 people during a rampage in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur. At the time, the government purchased hundreds of thousands of firearms from the Australian public.\nYet for the past five years there have been more guns registered in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur massacre, according to a report released in January by the Australia Institute, a think-tank. Expect much more discussion about that in the days ahead.\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated.\n","categories":["The Economist"],"tags":["Extremism","Terrorism","Public Security","Australia","Antisemitism"]},{"url":"/2025/12/23/China%20proved%20its%20strengths%20in%202025%E2%80%94and%20Donald%20Trump%20helped/","content":"China proved its strengths in 2025—and Donald Trump helped\nThe big noise in 2025 has been President Donald Trump. Launching a barrage of executive orders, he directed his fire at target after target. With the aid of Elon Musk, he attempted to dismantle the federal bureaucracy. On “Liberation Day” he rewrote the rules of trade. Around the world he imposed peace and threatened war.\nHowever, the big beneficiary has been President Xi Jinping. This year China defied Mr Trump’s attempt to use tariffs to force a show of submission. By turning the tables, Mr Xi revealed just how much America actually depends on his policies. In this round of the superpowers’ fight for 21st-century supremacy, it was a victory for China.\nChina’s industrial chokeholdsThis year showed the power of China’s industrial chokeholds. China’s share of the world’s manufacturing value added exceeds one-third, giving it the power to disrupt global supply chains overnight. In green technology, Chinese firms supply thematerials, components and finished goods for 60-80% of solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. DeepSeek showed what China can do in artificial intelligence, despite America’s best efforts to hobble it. China’s drug firms now run nearly as many clinical trials as their American peers—and do them faster.\nTwo decades ago Western firms invested in China to take advantage of its cheap producers and huge market. Today they build laboratories there.\nIn 2025 Mr Xi showed he is willing to use China’s dominance as not just a source of wealth, but of power. His restrictions on rare-earth exports are one example of how China can use other countries’ dependency as a weapon. Findings this month from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute show that China leads in research in 66 of 74 fields, measured by its share of key scientific papers. These include over two dozen areas, such as computer vision and grid integration, where it has a chokehold.\nHow Mr Trump helped Mr XiThe extraordinary thing is that Mr Trump has played into Mr Xi’s hands, both with his tariffs abroad and his wrecking-ball at home. Choosing bilateral tariffs as a way to inflict pain on China was a mistake. Partly because Chinese firms are used to harsh conditions and partly because China is not a democracy, its economy is better at enduring pain than America’s. Mr Trump could instead have co-ordinated a commercial encirclement of China by integrating more deeply with America’s allies. Foolishly, he preferred to alienate them with tariffs.\nLikewise, Mr Trump’s attack on science will impede American innovation. He has targeted researchers, cancelling grants and withholding billions of dollars in funding to institutions that he does not like. Framed as an effort to eliminate inefficiency and woke ideology, his efforts have curbed financing for vital research. His hostility to foreign scientists, especially ethnic Chinese ones, is part of a more general assault on immigration. Talented people will either leave America or choose not to move there. China has already benefited.\nThe balance of powerThe question is where this leaves the superpowers. In the short run, the advantage is surely with China. America and its allies cannot soon deprive it of its chokeholds. Should Mr Xi choose to throttle Taiwan, America and its allies may find that sanctions intended to force China to back off will trigger reprisals that cause more harm than their industries and citizens are willing to bear. That would have grave implications for East Asian security, and for America’s role in the western Pacific.\nIn the longer run, China’s dynamism could be stifled by its rigid politics. To see why, consider its economy. Factory-gate prices were 2.2% lower in November than a year earlier, and have declined for 38 months in a row. Property prices in the secondary market are more than 20% below their peak and still falling. Although the party has pledged to stimulate domestic demand next year, it will also double down on strategic manufacturing—the very thinking that has mired it in overcapacity.\nBy the end of 2026 that may seem like hubris. As provinces and cities struggle to pay down debt, stagnation could become even more entrenched, a bit like Japan’s lost decades. Deflation could worsen if countries unwilling to lose their own industries block more of China’s cut-price exports. Yet as Mr Xi prepares to start a fourth term in charge in 2027, his underlings seemingly cannot or will not challenge him.\nAmerica’s advantage—and its riskIn China the bigger the mistake, the less willing the party is to change course. By contrast, America has change built in—indeed maga’s bent for deregulation and its impatience with the suffocating effects of elite political correctness were examples of that principle in action. Whereas China is an ethno-nationalist state in which people who are not Han Chinese struggle to be accepted, America is founded on universal values that speak to every race and creed. These values have long made America a magnet for talent and enhanced its global influence. In the past they have also bound together its alliances.\nIn theory, all that should be the basis for renewal. However, Mr Trump scorns universal values as gimmicks exploited by cynical foreigners. Oppression does not shock him: he admires iron-fisted rulers, especially when they are also rich. As his recent National Security Strategy showed, maga sees ethnic and religious diversity as a threat, not a source of strength. If America is just one more ethno-nationalist project like Russia or China it will squander its greatest advantage.\nNext summer America will mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. That should be the occasion for a debate about the republic’s founding principles. America’s economy remains the envy of the world. Nowhere else can mobilise ideas and capital on such a scale. Its people possess tremendous reserves of skill and enterprise.\nIdeally, this would mean that the hopes of renewal will burn bright. The question is how much Mr Trump’s corruption of public life, his administration’s vindictiveness towards those in public service and his diminishment of Congress will dim America’s prospects. Mr Xi will be watching.\n"}]
